# Equalizer-APO-eq-generator
### V 0.1
this python script reads an audio recording of your speaker to calculate an eq profile for the Equalizer APO application to (hopefully) improve the sound.

#
# DOWNLOAD AND USE THIS SCRIPT AT YOUR OWN RISK!!
## Although I have already tested this program with my own equipment, I cannot garuntee that this will work perfectly and not destroy your computer and/or speakers.
### I do not hold any responsibility to any broken computers/speakers or any hearing problems that may occur after using this program.
please turn down your volume first then you can make it louder after i beg you pls\
== also be ready to mute the speaker ==
#

# How To Use?
1. adjust volume and delay before next step (to not play the audio too loudly/quietly or if you want to have prep time to be quiet)
2. click the blue "play sine test" button and record the audio with your phone or a microphone (perferably in a quiet environment)
3. for best results use a sound recording app with `NO AUTO GAIN CONTROL` mode [I used this to test the program.](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.hardcodedjoy.soundrecorder)
4. read the `.wav` file from the recording with "open wav file" button
5. wait for the waveform window to appear then point and click at exactly at the end of the first "beep" that you heard
6. adjust bass extension to your speakers' specification
7. click the "copy param text to clipboard" button to calculate and save the eq text to clipboard
8. paste text in Equalizer APO
9. if the eq parameters look too crazy try reducing the "eq intensity" with the slider and do step 5 and 6 again
10. hopefully after this your speakers will sound better and not blow up! (inspiring confidence!)
